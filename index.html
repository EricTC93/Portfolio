      <p>
        I'm a lover of games, math, logic, and coding and I believe those interests go together very well. I went from applied math major to a logic-loving coder that wouldn’t mind spending many hours solving problems or working on vast projects.
      </p>

      <p>
        Math has been my favorite subject since forever and I enjoy the many applications of it. I even volunteered as a math tutor and I was able to help others learn the subject. I enjoyed this experience and I wouldn't mind teaching others in subjects I know very well.
      </p>

      <p>
        Coding has become another favorite subject of mine that I'm currently pursuing a career in, more specifically in web development. From someone who loves games and logic puzzles, to figure out and create the logic for different types of projects gives me a satisfying feeling. This is why I love working in the back end of web development, figuring out and creating the logic for different kinds of applications is what gives me the most satisfaction.
      </p>
      
      <p>
          This is probably the reason why I enjoy languages like node.js, Javascript, and C++. I would love to work back-end and create a complex website that’s useful or websites for others to enjoy.
